# Clip

## Description
Clip is a simple tool intended to save data as simple text-based files on the user's machine. It is not *necessarily* text-based, but I haven't developed anything that complex. Think of it as a dumbed down database. It just takes some object and stores it on a file, then retrieves it as you will. Good for CLI tools!
